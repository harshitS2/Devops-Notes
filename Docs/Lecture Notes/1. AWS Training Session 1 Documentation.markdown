### Introduction to AWS and Cloud Computing

#### What is a Server?
- **Definition**: A computer or machine that hosts an application or website.
- **Types**:
  - **Physical**: Tangible devices (e.g., laptops, mobiles).
  - **Virtual**: Accessed remotely, not physically present (e.g., via AWS).
- **Examples**:
  - Instagram, WhatsApp, or bank servers going down indicate application hosting issues.
  - Mobile phones can act as servers (e.g., Mini Militia game server setup).
- **Q&A**:
  - **Q**: Can a mobile act as a server?
    - **A**: Yes, any device capable of hosting an application (e.g., Mini Militia server or crypto mining).

#### Why Cloud Computing?
- **Traditional Systems**:
  - **Issues**:
    - High cost (e.g., ₹1 lakh per computer × 100 = ₹1 crore).
    - Space, power, cooling, and maintenance requirements.
    - Lack of flexibility for short-term needs (e.g., 5-day resource requirement).
    - Disaster recovery challenges (e.g., flooding in Chennai affecting data centers).
  - **Example**: Physical setup requires manual purchases, setup, and maintenance, which is inefficient.
- **Cloud Benefits**:
  - **Cost-Effectiveness**: Pay-as-you-go model (hourly pricing, e.g., $0.01 for small machines, $5 for 192GB RAM).
  - **Scalability**: Increase/decrease resources on demand (e.g., start/stop servers instantly).
  - **Availability**: Multiple regions/availability zones ensure uptime (e.g., switch from Mumbai to Singapore if one region fails).
  - **Flexibility**: Choose OS (Mac, Ubuntu, Windows), RAM, storage, etc.
  - **Disaster Recovery**: Data centers in different regions mitigate risks.
  - **On-Demand Delivery**: Instant resource provisioning.
- **Rise of Cloud**:
  - Gained prominence during COVID-19 due to virtual needs.
  - Industries shifted to cloud for scalability and reliability.
- **Q&A**:
  - **Q**: Why switch from physical to cloud?
    - **A**: Cost, scalability, availability, security, and reduced maintenance.
  - **Q**: What is scaling?
    - **A**: Increasing or decreasing resources as per requirement (e.g., starting/stopping servers instantly).

#### What is AWS?
- **Definition**: A cloud service provider offering 150+ services (e.g., compute, storage, machine learning, AI).
- **Comparison**:
  - Similar to Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean, Alibaba Cloud, etc.
  - AWS is the oldest and most widely used, especially by US clients.
- **Focus**: Course focuses on DevOps-related services (80% of services relevant to DevOps).
- **Q&A**:
  - **Q**: Do we need to learn all 150 services?
    - **A**: No, focus on key DevOps services.
  - **Q**: How does AWS compare to Azure/GCP?
    - **A**: All provide similar services; AWS is popular in the US, Azure/GCP in APEC. Features are largely copied across clouds.

#### Types of Clouds
- **Public Cloud**:
  - Accessible to everyone (e.g., AWS free tier account).
  - Example: Anyone can create an AWS account after verification.
- **Private Cloud**:
  - Restricted access for security (e.g., defense, healthcare, finance).
  - Example: Indian Army or HDFC Bank’s internal systems.
- **Hybrid Cloud**:
  - Combines public and private clouds (90% of industries use this).
  - Example: TCS’s public investor page vs. private employee portal.
- **Q&A**:
  - **Q**: What are the different types of clouds?
    - **A**: Public, private, hybrid (not AWS, GCP, Azure, which are providers).

#### Computing Models
- **On-Premises**:
  - Full management of hardware and software (e.g., personal laptop).
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:
  - Hardware managed by provider (e.g., AWS EC2); user manages software, OS, data.
  - Example: AWS manages hardware; user configures OS and security.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:
  - Focus on application development; provider manages hardware and lower-level software.
  - Example: Elastic Beanstalk, where users focus on app code (e.g., Java, Node.js).
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**:
  - Users consume applications without managing anything (e.g., Gmail, YouTube, Hotstar).
- **Q&A**:
  - **Q**: What are IaaS, PaaS, SaaS?
    - **A**: IaaS (e.g., EC2), PaaS (e.g., Elastic Beanstalk), SaaS (e.g., Gmail).
  - **Q**: Example of PaaS in AWS?
    - **A**: Elastic Beanstalk.
  - **Q**: If building an app for Google Play Store, which model?
    - **A**: PaaS (development focus); using the app is SaaS.

#### AWS Infrastructure
- **Structure**:
  - **Regions**: 36 globally (e.g., Mumbai, Singapore, North Virginia).
    - New regions: Thailand (2025), Germany, Saudi Arabia (upcoming).
  - **Availability Zones (AZs)**: 2-6 per region (e.g., Mumbai has 3 AZs: 1a, 1b, 1c).
  - **Edge Locations/Data Centers**: Physical servers, not user-selectable for security.
- **Purpose**:
  - Regions: Choose based on user location (e.g., US users → US region).
  - AZs: Ensure high availability (e.g., if Andheri AZ fails, use Navi Mumbai AZ).
  - Data Centers: Managed by AWS, not user-selectable to prevent tampering.
- **Q&A**:
  - **Q**: How is AWS infrastructure divided?
    - **A**: Regions → Availability Zones → Edge Locations/Data Centers.
  - **Q**: If an application in one AZ fails, will AWS move it to another?
    - **A**: No, AWS doesn’t automatically move it. Users must duplicate applications across AZs for high availability using load balancers or auto-scaling.

#### Shared Responsibility Model
- **AWS Responsibilities**:
  - Manage hardware, data centers, and service availability (e.g., EC2, networking).
  - Ensure SLAs (e.g., 99.9% uptime).
- **Customer Responsibilities**:
  - Manage data, OS, security, encryption, and access control.
  - Example: If a user deletes files or servers, AWS won’t recover them.
- **Q&A**:
  - **Q**: If I delete something in AWS, will AWS help recover it?
    - **A**: No, AWS provides services but doesn’t manage user actions.
  - **Q**: How to retrieve data?
    - **A**: Use AWS Backup or disaster recovery services (costs apply).
  - **Q**: What if a developer deletes critical servers?
    - **A**: AWS won’t recover them; it’s the customer’s responsibility.
  - **Q**: Does AWS see my data if they recover it?
    - **A**: No, AWS doesn’t access user data to ensure security.

#### Service Level Agreement (SLA)
- **Definition**: A commitment to service availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime).
- **Implication**: If SLA is breached (e.g., only 98% uptime), AWS refunds the difference.
- **Example**: CrowdStrike issue affected Azure’s SLA, leading to refunds.
- **Q&A**:
  - **Q**: What is SLA?
    - **A**: Service Level Agreement, ensuring availability (e.g., 99.9%).
  - **Q**: How does a better SLA benefit?
    - **A**: Higher SLA (e.g., 99.99%) indicates more reliable service.

#### Global vs. Regional Services
- **Global Services**: Not tied to a region (e.g., IAM, Route 53, ACM, CloudFront, billing).
- **Regional Services**: 95% of services, tied to specific regions (e.g., EC2).
- **Q&A**:
  - **Q**: Name global services?
    - **A**: IAM, Route 53, ACM, CloudFront, billing.

### Practical Demonstrations
- **Server Creation/Deletion**:
  - Demonstrated starting and deleting an EC2 server to show scaling.
  - Emphasized deleting services after use to avoid costs.
- **Budget Setup**:
  - Navigate to AWS Billing → Budgets.
  - Create a zero-spend budget or set a limit (e.g., $2-5/month).
  - Email notifications at 85% and 100% usage.
  - Example: A student completed the course with only ₹23 charged using free tier.
- **AWS Account Creation**:
  - Official link: [AWS Account Creation](https://aws.amazon.com/).
  - Steps:
    1. Enter email, password, and account details.
    2. Add payment method (credit/debit card with international payment).
    3. Verify with a ₹2 charge.
    4. Select free tier (no support, only email assistance).
  - Recordings available for reference (13th and 20th).
