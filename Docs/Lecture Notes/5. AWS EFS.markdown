## Introduction to EFS

**Elastic File System (EFS)** is a fully managed, scalable, and elastic file storage system provided by AWS, designed for use with Linux-based workloads and on-premises servers. It allows multiple EC2 instances to access a shared file system concurrently, making it ideal for projects requiring centralized data access.

- **Key Features**:
  - Scalable: Automatically grows and shrinks as files are added or removed.
  - Regional Service: Available across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
  - Supports thousands of concurrent connections.
  - No hard size limit (can scale to petabytes).
  - Compatible with Linux and macOS (not Windows).

- **Comparison to NFS**:
  - EFS is AWS-specific, while NFS (Network File System) is a general protocol used in Linux for shared storage.
  - EFS is managed by AWS, whereas NFS requires manual setup.

---

## Why Use EFS?

EFS addresses scenarios where multiple users or servers need access to the same data without maintaining individual copies. For example:
- In a project with 100 team members, sharing 100 copies of data is inefficient and prone to synchronization issues.
- EFS provides a **shared storage** solution, allowing all members to access and update files in a centralized location.

**Use Cases**:
- Big data analytics (e.g., scientists collaborating on vaccine research).
- Media processing.
- Content management.
- Web serving.
- Home directories.

## Key Differences Between EBS and EFS

| **Feature**                     | **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**                     | **EFS (Elastic File System)**                     |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Connection Type**             | One-to-one (single EC2 instance)                 | Many-to-many (thousands of servers)              |
| **Availability Zones**          | Specific to one AZ                               | Available across all AZs in a region             |
| **Performance**                 | Faster (like a Ferrari, ideal for databases)     | Slower than EBS but sufficient for shared access |
| **Size Specification**          | Requires manual size specification (e.g., 1 GB)  | Automatically managed, no hard limit             |
| **OS Compatibility**            | Windows, Linux, macOS                           | Linux and macOS only (no Windows support)        |
| **Cost**                        | More expensive                                  | Cheaper, with cost-saving storage classes        |
| **Size Adjustment**             | Can increase size, cannot decrease              | Can increase and decrease dynamically            |

## Practical Demonstration

The session included a live demonstration of creating and using EFS with EC2 instances. Below is a structured breakdown of the process.

### Creating an EFS File System
1. Navigate to the AWS Management Console > EFS.
2. Click **Create file system**.
3. Provide a name (e.g., `abc`).
4. Select the appropriate region and create the file system.
5. Verify that the EFS is available across all AZs automatically.

**Note**: No storage size specification is required, as EFS is auto-scaling.

### Setting Up an EC2 Instance
1. Go to EC2 > **Launch Instance**.
2. Choose **Amazon Linux 2 AMI**, **t2.micro** instance type.
3. Use default security group (allow all traffic for demo purposes).
4. Launch the instance without a key pair for simplicity.

### Installing and Mounting EFS on EC2
1. Connect to the EC2 instance via SSH or EC2 Instance Connect.
2. Install the EFS utilities:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
   ```
3. Create a directory to mount EFS:
   ```bash
   mkdir efs
   ```
4. Verify the directory:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
5. Navigate to the EFS console, select the file system, and click **Attach**.
6. Copy the mount command (using EFS mount helper) and execute it on the EC2 instance:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-12345678:/ efs
   ```
   Replace `fs-12345678` with your EFS file system ID.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **Botocore3 Error**: Some regions may lack the `botocore3` dependency.
  - Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y python3-pip
    pip3 install botocore
    ```
  - Re-run the mount command.
- **Timeout Error**: Check the security group to ensure NFS traffic (port 2049) is allowed.
  - Update the EC2 and EFS security groups to allow inbound NFS traffic.

### Verifying Shared Storage
1. Create files in the EFS directory on one EC2 instance:
   ```bash
   sudo touch efs/file1 efs/file2 efs/file3
   ls efs
   ```
2. Launch another EC2 instance, mount the same EFS, and verify the files:
   ```bash
   cd efs
   ls
   ```
3. Files created on one instance are visible on others, confirming shared storage.

    - 1 GB.

25. **What is the minimum storage for a Linux EC2 instance?**
    - 8 GB.

26. **What happens to public and private IPs when an EC2 instance is stopped?**
    - Public IP changes on restart; private IP remains the same.

27. **How do you maintain a static public IP?**
    - Use an Elastic IP (a paid service).

28. **How can you switch users to a new server with critical data?**
    - Disassociate the Elastic IP from the old server and associate it with the new server.

29. **What is user data in EC2?**
    - Commands executed during instance launch to configure the server (e.g., installing software).

30. **What are placement groups, and what are their types?**
    - Placement groups control how EC2 instances are placed in AWS data centers:
      - **Cluster**: All instances together for low latency.
      - **Partition**: Instances in groups for high availability and speed.
      - **Spread**: Instances separated for maximum availability.

31. **What is a shebang in user data scripts?**
    - A line (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`) specifying the script’s shell or terminal type.

32. **If both allow and deny policies are attached to a user, which takes precedence?**

## Actionable Steps to Master EFS

To become proficient in EFS, follow these steps to practice and reinforce your understanding.

### Step-by-Step Commands

1. **Create an EFS File System**:
   - AWS Console: EFS > Create file system > Name: `my-efs` > Create.
   - Verify availability across AZs in the **Network** tab.

2. **Launch Two EC2 Instances**:
   - EC2 > Launch Instance > Amazon Linux 2, t2.micro, default security group.
   - Launch two instances: `efs-server1` and `efs-server2`.

3. **Install EFS Utilities on Both Instances**:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
   ```

4. **Create Mount Point**:
   ```bash
   mkdir efs
   ls
   ```

5. **Mount EFS on Both Instances**:
   - In EFS console, select your file system, click **Attach**, and copy the mount command.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-12345678:/ efs
     ```
   - Replace `fs-12345678` with your EFS ID.

6. **Test Shared Storage**:
   - On `efs-server1`:
     ```bash
     sudo touch efs/file1 efs/file2
     ls efs
     ```
   - On `efs-server2`:
     ```bash
     cd efs
     ls
     ```
   - Verify `file1` and `file2` are visible.

7. **Troubleshoot Botocore3 Error** (if encountered):
   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y python3-pip
   pip3 install botocore
   ```
   - Re-run the mount command.

8. **Clean Up**:
   - Unmount EFS:
     ```bash
     sudo umount efs
     ```
   - Terminate EC2 instances.
   - Delete EFS file system to avoid charges.

### Practice Tasks
1. **Create and Mount EFS**:
   - Set up EFS and mount it on three EC2 instances in different AZs.
   - Create files on one instance and verify visibility on others.

2. **Simulate a Real-World Scenario**:
   - Create a file system for a team of 10 developers.
   - Mount EFS on their EC2 instances and share a `project.txt` file.
   - Edit the file on one instance and confirm updates on others.

3. **Test Storage Classes**:
   - Create files in EFS and monitor their transition to Infrequent Access (after 30 days) using AWS CloudWatch.
   - Note: This requires a longer-term AWS account.

4. **Handle Errors**:
   - Intentionally misconfigure the security group to block port 2049 and troubleshoot the timeout error.
   - Fix by adding an inbound rule for NFS (TCP, port 204 yourselves).

5. **Explore Elastic IP**:
   - Launch an EC2 instance with a web server using user data:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     yum update -y
     yum install -y httpd
     systemctl start httpd
     systemctl enable httpd
     echo "<h1>Hello from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
     ```
   - Associate an Elastic IP, stop/restart the instance, and verify the IP remains static.

6. **Backup and Restore**:
   - Create an AMI of an EC2 instance with EFS mounted.
   - Launch a new instance from the AMI and verify EFS connectivity.

7. **Documentation Review**:
   - Study the [AWS EFS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html) for updates.
   - Focus on performance modes (General Purpose vs. Max I/O) and lifecycle policies.

## Additional Notes

### Storage Classes
- **Standard**: Default, for frequently accessed files.
- **Infrequent Access (IA)**: For files not accessed for 30 days.
- **Archive**: For files accessed annually (e.g., audit logs).
- Transitions are automatic based on lifecycle policies, reducing costs.

### Placement Groups
- **Cluster**: Low latency, all instances in one location.
- **Partition**: Balanced availability and speed, grouped instances.
- **Spread**: High availability, instances isolated.
- Theoretical concept, as you cannot see physical placement.

### Elastic IP
- A paid service to maintain a static public IP.
- Useful for websites or services requiring consistent access.
- Steps: Allocate > Associate with EC2 > Disassociate/Release when done.

### Basic Linux Commands
- `mkdir <name>`: Create a directory.
