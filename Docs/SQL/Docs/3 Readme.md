# SQL DQL (SELECT) Learning Session Documentation

**Date:** April 22, 2025  
**Instructor:** Unnamed  
**Session Objective:** Introduce participants to hands-on SQL learning, focusing on Data Query Language (DQL) commands, specifically the `SELECT` statement, to extract data from a database using MySQL Workbench. Cover advanced `SELECT` features, including filtering, sorting, limiting, aggregate functions, grouping, subqueries, and aliasing.

---

## 1. Session Overview

This session built on the previous MySQL and SQL learning sessions, transitioning to Data Query Language (DQL) with a focus on the `SELECT` command, critical for data analysts. Participants learned to extract data from a database using various `SELECT` clauses (`WHERE`, `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and subqueries) and aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`). The session was hands-on, with participants creating a database, populating it with data, and executing queries in MySQL Workbench. The instructor addressed errors, clarified concepts, and shared scripts for practice.

### Key Objectives:
- Execute `SELECT` commands to extract data with various clauses and functions.
- Create and populate a database for hands-on practice.
- Understand filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregating data.
- Introduce subqueries for complex queries.
- Address participant errors and doubts through demonstrations and screen sharing.
- Share SQL scripts for continued practice.

## 3. Detailed Session Breakdown

### 3.1 Introduction and Setup
- **Recap of Previous Session:** The instructor confirmed the last topic was SQL constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, DEFAULT, CHECK, PRIMARY KEY) and noted recovery from a recent illness, resuming the session as planned.
- **Session Goals:**
  - Focus on `SELECT`, the most important SQL command for data analysts, to extract data.
  - Cover multiple ways to retrieve desired results using `SELECT` clauses and functions.
  - Ensure hands-on practice with a sufficiently large dataset.
- **Setup Instructions:**
  - Participants opened MySQL Workbench and created a new SQL script, saved as `SQL_select.sql` or `SQL_DQL.sql`, in their SQL folder.
  - The instructor used a single screen for demonstration, ensuring visibility of Workbench.
  - Participants confirmed they could see Workbench on their screens.

### 3.2 Database and Table Creation
To enable hands-on practice, the instructor created a new database (`demo1`) and a table (`employee`) with sufficient data (50 rows) for complex queries.

#### Steps and Commands:
1. **Create Database:**
   - Command: `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS demo1;`
   - Purpose: Creates a database, avoiding errors if it already exists.
   - Verified with `SHOW DATABASES;`.

2. **Select Database:**
   - Command: `USE demo1;`
   - Purpose: Sets `demo1` as the active database.

3. **Drop Existing Table (if any):**
   - Command: `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employee;`
   - Purpose: Ensures a clean slate by removing any existing `employee` table.

4. **Create Employee Table:**
   - The instructor initially made an error in the table creation (missing `department` column), which was corrected.
   - Corrected Command:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE employee (
         emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         f_name VARCHAR(50),
         l_name VARCHAR(50),
         gender CHAR(1),
         city VARCHAR(100),
         salary INT,
         department VARCHAR(50)
     );
     ```
   - Verified with `DESCRIBE employee;`.

5. **Populate Employee Table:**
   - The instructor provided a script to insert 50 rows but involved participants by assigning a task to contribute data.
   - **Task:** Each participant shared a tuple in the chat with:
     - `emp_id` (136–150, unique).
     - `f_name`, `l_name`, `gender`, `city` (in quotes, first letter capitalized).
     - `salary` (numeric, no quotes).
     - `department` (one of: Accounting, Marketing, HR, R&D, Engineering, Finance, Sales, IT, Management).
   - Example Tuple: `(136, 'Ajay', 'Sharma', 'M', 'Delhi', 80000, 'Finance')`
   - Issues:
     - Some participants included quotes around `salary`, causing errors.
     - Incorrect department names (e.g., “management” instead of “Management”) or invalid values.
     - Missing commas or incorrect formatting.
   - Corrections:
     - Instructor reviewed chat submissions, corrected errors (e.g., line 56 comma issue, line 139 salary quotes).
     - Ensured 50 valid rows were inserted.
   - Command (simplified example):
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO employee VALUES
         (101, 'Abhay', 'Kumar', 'M', 'Delhi', 750000, 'Finance'),
         (102, 'Abhijit', 'Verma', 'M', 'Pune', 80000, 'Marketing'),
         -- ... 48 more rows ...
         (150, 'Vijay', 'Singh', 'M', 'Mumbai', 120000, 'Engineering');
     ```
   - Verified with `SELECT * FROM employee;`, confirming 50 rows affected.

#### Script Sharing:
- The instructor shared the complete script (`SQL_select.sql`) via Zoom chat, designed to:
  - Handle existing databases/tables using `IF NOT EXISTS` and `IF EXISTS`.
  - Create the `employee` table and insert 50 rows.
  - Allow participants to execute it without errors, regardless of prior database state.
- Instructions:
  - Save the script in the SQL folder.
  - Open in Workbench (File > Open SQL Script).
  - Select all commands and execute using the lightning bolt icon.

#### Participant Issues:
- **File Download and Execution:**
  - **Pallavi:** Initially changed the script name, causing confusion. Resolved by re-downloading and saving with the original name (`SQL_select.sql`).
  - **Ramaswamy:** Opened the script by double-clicking, connecting to an incorrect server instance. Resolved by closing Workbench, reopening, and using File > Open SQL Script.
  - **General:** Some participants used `Ctrl+Enter` (executes single command) instead of the lightning bolt (executes all selected commands). Resolved via screen-sharing demonstrations.
- **Execution Errors:**
  - Unknown column `department` due to initial table creation error. Fixed by correcting the `CREATE TABLE` command.
  - Syntax errors (e.g., missing commas in INSERT). Fixed by reviewing and correcting tuples.

#### Hands-on Practice:
- Participants executed the shared script to create the `demo1` database and `employee` table.
- Verified with `SELECT * FROM employee;`, confirming 50 rows and correct schema.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS demo1;
USE demo1;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employee;
CREATE TABLE employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    f_name VARCHAR(50),
    l_name VARCHAR(50),
    gender CHAR(1),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    salary INT,
    department VARCHAR(50)
);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES
    (101, 'Abhay', 'Kumar', 'M', 'Delhi', 750000, 'Finance'),
    (102, 'Abhijit', 'Verma', 'M', 'Pune', 80000, 'Marketing'),
    (103, 'Abhishek', 'Sharma', 'M', 'Hyderabad', 120000, 'Engineering'),
    (104, 'Ajay', 'Singh', 'M', 'Mumbai', 85000, 'HR'),
    (105, 'Akshita', 'Patel', 'F', 'Jaipur', 90000, 'R&D'),
    -- ... (45 more rows, abbreviated for brevity) ...
    (150, 'Vijay', 'Singh', 'M', 'Mumbai', 120000, 'Engineering');
SELECT * FROM employee;
```

### 3.3 SELECT Command Basics
The instructor introduced the `SELECT` command, emphasizing its role in data extraction.

#### Commands Covered:
1. **Basic SELECT:**
   - Syntax: `SELECT * FROM employee;`
   - Purpose: Retrieves all columns and rows from the `employee` table.
   - Output: Displays 50 rows with all columns (`emp_id`, `f_name`, `l_name`, `gender`, `city`, `salary`, `department`).

2. **Select Specific Columns:**
   - Syntax: `SELECT f_name FROM employee;`
   - Purpose: Retrieves only the `f_name` column.
   - Example: `SELECT f_name, salary FROM employee;`
   - Output: Displays `f_name` and `salary` for all 50 rows.

#### Hands-on Practice:
- Participants executed `SELECT * FROM employee;` and `SELECT f_name, salary FROM employee;` to verify data.
- Encouraged to read errors in the Action Output pane if issues arose.

#### Common Errors and Fixes:
- **Syntax Errors:** Incorrect column names (e.g., `fname` instead of `f_name`). Fixed by checking `DESCRIBE employee;`.
- **No Database Selected:** Missing `USE demo1;`. Fixed by executing it.

### 3.4 Advanced SELECT Features
The instructor covered advanced `SELECT` clauses to filter, sort, and limit data.

#### Clauses Covered:
1. **DISTINCT:**
   - Syntax: `SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employee;`
   - Purpose: Retrieves unique values from the `department` column.
   - Output: Lists unique departments (e.g., Marketing, Finance, Engineering, HR, R&D, Accounting, Sales, IT, Management).
   - Example: `SELECT DISTINCT city FROM employee;`
   - Output: Lists unique cities (e.g., Delhi, Pune, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Jaipur, Calcutta, etc.).
   - Note: Corrected participant input (e.g., “Tamil Nadu” as a city, suggested changing to Chennai).

2. **WHERE:**
   - Syntax: `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE department = 'Finance';`
   - Purpose: Filters rows based on a condition.
   - Examples:
     - `SELECT emp_id, f_name, l_name, department FROM employee WHERE department = 'Finance';` (specific columns).
     - `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > 100000;` (salary > 1 lakh).
     - `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE gender = 'F';` (female employees).
   - Combining Conditions:
     - `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > 100000 AND department = 'Finance';`
     - `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE city = 'Jaipur' OR city = 'Delhi';`
   - Operator Support: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`.

3. **BETWEEN:**
   - Syntax: `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary BETWEEN 80000 AND 150000;`
   - Purpose: Filters rows where a column value is within a range (inclusive).
   - Equivalent: `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary >= 80000 AND salary <= 150000;`
   - Note: Inclusive of upper and lower bounds.

4. **IN and NOT IN:**
   - Syntax: `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE city IN ('Jaipur', 'Delhi', 'Pune', 'Mumbai');`
   - Purpose: Filters rows where a column value matches any in a list.
   - Example: `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE city NOT IN ('Jaipur', 'Delhi', 'Pune', 'Mumbai');`
   - Output: Excludes specified cities.
   - Advantage: Simplifies multiple OR conditions (e.g., `city = 'Jaipur' OR city = 'Delhi' OR ...`).

5. **LIKE (Pattern Matching):**
   - Syntax: `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE f_name LIKE 'A%';`
   - Purpose: Filters rows based on a pattern.
   - Patterns:
     - `A%`: Starts with A, followed by any characters.
     - `%t`: Ends with t.
     - `%pur`: Ends with “pur” (e.g., Jaipur, Solapur).
   - Example: `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE city LIKE '%pur';`
   - Output: Cities ending with “pur”.

6. **ORDER BY:**
   - Syntax: `SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY salary;`
   - Purpose: Sorts results (default: ascending, `ASC`).
   - Examples:
     - `SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC;` (descending).
     - `SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY f_name;` (alphabetical, ascending).
     - `SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY f_name DESC;` (reverse alphabetical).
   - Multiple Columns:
     - `SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC, f_name ASC;`
     - Purpose: Sorts by `salary` (descending), with ties broken by `f_name` (ascending).
     - Example Output: Employees with 750000 salary sorted alphabetically by `f_name`.

7. **LIMIT:**
   - Syntax: `SELECT * FROM employee LIMIT 5;`
   - Purpose: Restricts the number of rows returned.
   - Examples:
     - `SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 3;` (top 3 highest salaries).
     - `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE department = 'Finance' ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 3;` (top 3 salaries in Finance).
   - Advanced Usage (Skip and Take):
     - `SELECT * FROM employee LIMIT 3, 2;` (skip 3 rows, take next 2).
     - Example: `SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1, 1;` (second highest salary).
     - Example: `SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY salary ASC LIMIT 1, 1;` (second lowest salary).

#### Hands-on Practice:
- Participants executed queries for each clause, including:
  - `SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employee;`
  - `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > 100000 AND department = 'Finance';`
  - `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE city IN ('Delhi', 'Jaipur');`
  - `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE f_name LIKE 'A%';`
  - `SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 3;`
- Tasks Assigned:
  - Extract male employees in Finance, descending by salary.
  - Extract employees with top 3 highest salaries in Finance.
  - Most participants submitted correct queries via direct messages.

#### Common Errors and Fixes:
- **Incorrect Clause Order:** Writing `LIMIT` before `ORDER BY`. Fixed by emphasizing order: `SELECT > WHERE > ORDER BY > LIMIT`.
- **Case Sensitivity:** Incorrect department names (e.g., “finance” vs. “Finance”). Noted that MySQL is case-insensitive for values but recommended consistency.
- **Syntax Errors:** Missing quotes, incorrect operators, or misspelled column names. Fixed by reviewing `DESCRIBE employee;` and error messages.
- **Logic Errors:** Misinterpreting conditions (e.g., `city = 'Jaipur' AND city = 'Delhi'`). Clarified that an employee cannot be in multiple cities; use `OR` or `IN`.

#### Participant Issues:
- **Prabhakar:** Incorrect `WHERE` syntax for city and department. Resolved by sharing and correcting the query in chat.
- **Pallavi:** Confusion with `LIMIT` for second highest salary. Resolved by correcting `SELECT MAX(salary)` syntax.
- **Shalini:** General confusion with clause order. Clarified via query order explanation (see Section 3.7).

### 3.5 Break
- A 10–15 minute break was taken after covering advanced `SELECT` features, allowing participants to practice and the instructor to address a keyboard issue (some keys not working).

### 3.6 Aggregate Functions
The instructor introduced aggregate functions to perform calculations on data.

#### Functions Covered:
1. **COUNT:**
   - Syntax: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee;`
   - Purpose: Counts the number of rows.
   - Output: 50 (total employees).
   - Examples:
     - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee WHERE gender = 'M';` (32 male employees).
     - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee WHERE department = 'Finance';` (12 employees).
     - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee WHERE salary > 100000;` (6 employees).

2. **SUM:**
   - Syntax: `SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employee;`
   - Purpose: Calculates the sum of a numerical column.
   - Output: 55,74,020 (total salaries).
   - Example: `SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employee WHERE department = 'Engineering';` (sum of Engineering salaries).

3. **AVG:**
   - Syntax: `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee;`
   - Purpose: Calculates the average of a numerical column.
   - Output: 1,11,480 (average salary).
   - Examples:
     - `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee WHERE gender = 'M';` (1,16,000).
     - `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee WHERE gender = 'F';` (1,02,000).
     - `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee WHERE department = 'Finance';`.

4. **MIN and MAX:**
   - Syntax: `SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employee;`
   - Purpose: Returns the minimum value.
   - Output: 20,000 (lowest salary).
   - Syntax: `SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee;`
   - Purpose: Returns the maximum value.
   - Output: 7,50,000 (highest salary).
   - Examples:
     - `SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employee WHERE department = 'Finance';` (50,000).
     - `SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND gender = 'F';` (2,00,000).

#### Hands-on Practice:
- Participants executed one example of each function (e.g., `COUNT(*)` for males, `AVG(salary)` for Finance, `MAX(salary)` for Marketing females).
- Encouraged to resolve errors independently before seeking help.

#### Common Errors and Fixes:
- **Function Misuse:** Using `SUM` on non-numerical columns. Clarified that `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` apply to numerical columns only.
- **Missing Parentheses:** Writing `COUNT *` instead of `COUNT(*)`. Fixed by correcting syntax.
- **Confusion with Rows vs. Values:** Expecting `MIN(salary)` to return the entire row. Clarified that aggregate functions return single values, unlike `LIMIT`.

### 3.7 GROUP BY and HAVING
The instructor introduced `GROUP BY` to aggregate data by categories and `HAVING` to filter grouped results.

#### GROUP BY:
- Syntax: `SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employee GROUP BY department;`
- Purpose: Groups rows by a column and applies an aggregate function.
- Output: Number of employees per department (e.g., Marketing: 8, Finance: 12, Engineering: 8).
- Example: `SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employee GROUP BY department;`
- Output: Average salary per department.

#### Aliasing:
- Syntax: `SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS number_of_employees FROM employee GROUP BY department;`
- Purpose: Renames the output column for clarity.
- Example: `SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employee GROUP BY department;`
- Output: Displays “average_salary” instead of `AVG(salary)`.

#### HAVING:
- Syntax: `SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employee GROUP BY department HAVING average_salary > 100000;`
- Purpose: Filters grouped results based on a condition.
- Note: `HAVING` is used after `GROUP BY` because the aggregated value (e.g., `AVG(salary)`) does not exist before grouping, unlike `WHERE`.
- Example: `SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employee WHERE gender = 'F' GROUP BY department HAVING average_salary > 80000;`
- Output: Departments with average female salaries > 80,000 (e.g., Marketing).

#### Query Order:
- The instructor provided the standard order for `SELECT` queries:
  1. `SELECT` (columns or functions)
  2. `WHERE` (filter rows)
  3. `GROUP BY` (group rows)
  4. `HAVING` (filter groups)
  5. `ORDER BY` (sort results)
  6. `LIMIT` (restrict rows)
- Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
  FROM employee
  WHERE gender = 'M'
  GROUP BY department
  HAVING average_salary > 80000
  ORDER BY average_salary DESC
  LIMIT 3;
  ```
- Purpose: Retrieves top 3 departments with average male salaries > 80,000, sorted descending.

#### Hands-on Practice:
- Tasks Assigned (via direct messages):
  - Top 3 cities with highest number of employees:
    ```sql
    SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS number_of_employees
    FROM employee
    GROUP BY city
    ORDER BY number_of_employees DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```
    - Output: Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai.
  - Top 3 departments with highest number of female employees:
    ```sql
    SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS female_employees
    FROM employee
    WHERE gender = 'F'
    GROUP BY department
    ORDER BY female_employees DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```
    - Output: Finance, Marketing, HR.
  - Top 3 departments with highest average female salaries:
    ```sql
    SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
    FROM employee
    WHERE gender = 'F'
    GROUP BY department
    ORDER BY average_salary DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```
    - Output: Marketing, HR, Finance.

#### Common Errors and Fixes:
- **Missing ORDER BY:** Forgetting to sort results (e.g., Anita’s query). Fixed by adding `ORDER BY`.
- **Incorrect Aggregate Function:** Using `COUNT(*)` for average salary queries. Fixed by using `AVG(salary)`.
- **WHERE vs. HAVING:** Applying `WHERE` after `GROUP BY`. Clarified that `HAVING` is for aggregated values.
- **Public Chat Answers:** Pallavi and others shared answers publicly, spoiling tasks. Instructor addressed with humor and reactions.

#### Participant Issues:
- **Anita:** Missed `ORDER BY` in department query. Corrected via feedback.
- **Archana:** Forgot `WHERE gender = 'F'` in female employee query. Corrected via direct message.
- **Shalini:** Confusion between `salary` and `AVG(salary)` in `HAVING`. Clarified that `AVG(salary)` exists only after `GROUP BY`.

### 3.8 Subqueries
The instructor introduced subqueries to handle complex queries.

#### Subqueries:
- Definition: A query nested within another query.
- Syntax:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employee
  WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee);
  ```
- Purpose: Retrieves employees with salaries greater than the average salary.
- Process:
  - Inner query (`SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee`) calculates the average salary (e.g., 1,11,480).
  - Outer query filters employees where `salary > 1,11,480`.

- Example (Second Highest Salary):
  ```sql
  SELECT MAX(salary)
  FROM employee
  WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee);
  ```
- Purpose: Retrieves the second highest salary by excluding the maximum salary.
- Alternative:
  ```sql
  SELECT MAX(salary)
  FROM employee
  WHERE salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee);
  ```

#### Hands-on Practice:
- Task: Extract employees with salary greater than the average salary.
- Most participants understood the concept but struggled with syntax.

#### Common Errors and Fixes:
- **Syntax Errors:** Missing parentheses around subqueries. Fixed by adding `()`.
- **Logic Errors:** Expecting subqueries to return rows instead of a single value. Clarified that subqueries in `WHERE` typically return a single value.
- **Pallavi:** Incorrect `SELECT *` for second highest salary. Corrected to `SELECT MAX(salary)`.

### 3.9 Break
- A second 10–15 minute break was taken before the doubt session, allowing the instructor to share all SQL scripts.

### 3.10 Doubt Resolution and Feedback
The instructor addressed doubts, shared materials, and collected feedback.

#### Materials Shared:
- All SQL scripts (`SQL_DDL.sql`, `SQL_DML.sql`, `SQL_Constraints.sql`, `SQL_select.sql`) were shared via Zoom chat.
- Instructions: Save in SQL folder, open in Workbench, execute as needed.

#### Doubts Addressed:
- **Shalini:**
  - Issue: New MySQL installation, confusion with execution.
  - Resolution: Demonstrated opening `SQL_select.sql`, selecting commands, and executing with the lightning bolt icon. Clarified `Ctrl+Enter` for single commands.
  - Clarified that database changes are permanent and multiple scripts can be opened in separate Workbench tabs.
- **Pallavi:**
  - Issue: Incorrect subquery for second highest salary.
  - Resolution: Corrected to `SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee);`.
- **General:**
  - Question: Order of learning SQL topics.
  - Answer: DDL > DML > Constraints > SELECT (SELECT can be learned independently).
- **Prabhakar:** Clarified `LIMIT` usage and query syntax via chat.
- **Subquery Clarification:** Explained as nested queries, using the average salary example.

#### Feedback:
- A poll was launched to collect feedback (5-star scale).
- Results: ~90% gave 5 stars, indicating positive reception of the session.
- Note: Some participants were panelists, affecting poll visibility. Instructor ensured all could access it.

#### Other Discussions:
- **Career Advice:** The instructor recommended a MacBook Air M1/M2 for data science (budget-dependent) and shared a story about purchasing an RTX 3060Ti graphics card during the crypto boom.
- **Holiday Request:** Participants were encouraged to request Diwali holidays (10–12 November) due to festival importance.
- **Instructor’s Birthday:** Mentioned the next day (April 23, 2025) was their birthday but would not take a holiday due to prior cancellations.

## 4. Challenges and Observations
- **Technical Issues:**
  - Instructor’s keyboard malfunctioned, causing typos (e.g., “employee” misspelled). Mitigated by using an alternate keyboard.
  - Participants struggled with Workbench navigation (e.g., double-clicking scripts, incorrect execution methods).
- **Error Management:** Frequent syntax errors (e.g., missing commas, quotes around `salary`) and logical errors (e.g., `WHERE` vs. `HAVING`) required significant troubleshooting.
- **Participant Engagement:** Varying proficiency levels; some participants (e.g., Shalini) needed basic guidance, while others (e.g., Rizhu, Avinash) submitted correct queries.
- **Time Management:** Extensive error resolution and screen-sharing reduced time for advanced topics (e.g., subqueries were rushed).
- **Data Quality:** Random participant data led to unrealistic scenarios (e.g., Management department with low salaries), but matched real-world patterns in some cases (e.g., Marketing salaries for females).

---

## 5. Recommendations for Future Sessions
1. **Pre-Session Preparation:**
   - Share scripts and a Workbench guide in advance, emphasizing correct execution methods (lightning bolt vs. `Ctrl+Enter`).
   - Provide a sample dataset to ensure consistency and avoid errors from participant input.
2. **Error Handling:**
   - Create a quick-reference guide for common errors (e.g., syntax, `WHERE` vs. `HAVING`, subquery parentheses).
   - Allocate specific time for error-sharing via chat or screen sharing.
3. **Conceptual Clarity:**
   - Use visual aids (e.g., query execution flow diagrams) to clarify clause order (`SELECT > WHERE > GROUP BY > HAVING > ORDER BY > LIMIT`).
   - Reinforce differences between aggregate functions (values) and `LIMIT` (rows).
4. **Practice Opportunities:**
   - Assign targeted exercises for each clause/function (e.g., 3 queries per topic).
   - Recommend platforms like HackerRank or LeetCode for SQL practice.
5. **Technical Support:**
   - Provide a pre-session checklist for Workbench setup and script execution.
   - Offer a contact for technical issues (e.g., Zoom, Workbench connectivity).
6. **Time Management:**
   - Limit error resolution to 5–10 minutes per participant to cover all topics thoroughly.
   - Schedule subqueries and joins as separate sessions for deeper exploration.

---

## 6. Conclusion
The session successfully introduced participants to the `SELECT` command, covering basic and advanced features, aggregate functions, grouping, and subqueries through hands-on practice in MySQL Workbench. Participants created a 50-row `employee` table, executed complex queries, and resolved errors with instructor guidance. The shared scripts and doubt session ensured accessibility, though technical issues and varying proficiency levels posed challenges. The next session will cover `JOIN` operations to extract data from multiple tables, critical for relational databases.

**Next Session:** Exploration of `JOIN` commands for multi-table data extraction, with hands-on exercises.
